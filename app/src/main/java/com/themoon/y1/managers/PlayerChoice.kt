/**
 * The player that plays a local audio file, and the next player when it fails. The main player
 * ([AudioPlayerManager]) and the Music Quiz clips use it, so that a file that one player cannot play goes to the
 * other player, and later plays of the file go directly to the player that works.
 *
 * - Main player ([forPlayback]): ExoPlayer, with the app's audio processors. FLAC files go first to Android's
 *   MediaPlayer, because ExoPlayer's FLAC decoder stayed at 0:00 on some devices. With Mono Audio On, FLAC files
 *   go first to ExoPlayer, because only its processors can mix the channels; MediaPlayer is then the fallback.
 * - Music Quiz clip ([FOR_CLIP]): MediaPlayer first for each file (as before), ExoPlayer when MediaPlayer fails.
 *
 * Main thread only.
